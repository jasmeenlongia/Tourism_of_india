    <h3>About :</h3>
<p>Home to one of the 7 wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal, Agra is a sneak peek into the architectural history with other UNESCO World Heritage Sites as Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. History, architecture, romance all together create the magic of Agra and hence makes for a must-visit for anyone living in or visiting India.</p>

<p>Located on the banks of river Yamuna, History fanatics, as well as architecture buffs, can have a ball here with the sheer expanse of the Mughal art and culture on display. Apart from its monuments, the city also has some exciting stuff for foodies - including the famous Agra ka Petha and amazing chaat and Lassi.</p>

<p>However, be a little cautious about conmen in the guise of unofficial tour guides and fake handicrafts.
    </p>
    <p>Agra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.
